A comprehensive optimization tool for Windows 10/11


## How to Use
First, you need an `optimizer.toml` file. There is already one included in the program. You can create your own by looking at that example and checking the documentation on this GitHub page.  
After that, simply run:

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cem-ali152/winoptimize-tools/main/gifs/demo.gif)
```cmd
Winoptimizer0.0.1.exe —cf your_optimizer.toml

```

That’s it.

## Terms of Use

If you don’t know what you’re doing, please do NOT create your own optimizer.toml file.
If you encounter any errors while using Windows, I am NOT responsible under any circumstances.

## Support

If you’d like to support me and help the project grow, please consider making even a small donation.
Remember, this project improves thanks to all of you.
