[Türkçe](tr_md/readme_tr.md),[русский](ru_md/readme_ru.md)
## Usage

First, you need an `optimizer.toml` file. The program already comes with a default `optimizer.toml`. You can check out [this example](https://github.com/cem-ali152/winoptimize-tools/blob/main/default.toml) to create your own file or follow [this guide](how_to_make_custom_profil_en.md).

Then, all you need to do is:

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cem-ali152/winoptimize-tools/refs/heads/main/demo_1.png)

```cmd
Winoptimizer.exe —cf your_optimizer.toml
```

That's it!

## Terms of Use

If you don’t know what you are doing, please do **not** create your own `optimizer.toml` file. The developer assumes **no responsibility** for any issues or errors that may occur while using Windows.

## Support

If you want to support the project and help it grow, even a small donation is appreciated. Remember, this project develops thanks to contributions from users like you.

If you want, I can also make a **slightly more polished, natural English version** that reads like official documentation. Do you want me to do that?
